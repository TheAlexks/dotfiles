*** Imports
To be able to actually code in  haskell, we need to import some stuff.

**** What do we need to import?
***** Syntax
import + name of library

import Data.List

And now we can code!

** Hello, world!
import Data.List

And now, there's a couple of ways to print out something.

*** 1st way
main = print("Hello, world!")

*** 2nd way
main = putStrLn "Hello, world!"
    Note, "putStrLn" can only be used with strings.

*** 3rd way
Now, these are variations, kinda.

main = do
    print("Hello, world!")

*** 4th way
main = do{
    print("Hello, world!");
    return()
}

** Maths
Ofc, we can do some calculations.

myPlus = 5 + 4
myMinus = 5 - 4
myTimes = 5 * 4
mySlash = 5 / 4

** Variables
*** How to declare a variable?
For example, integer.

myInt :: Int
myInt = 5

Ta-da!
